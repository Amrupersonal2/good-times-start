- Keep IndexedDB as the offline source of truth and mirror signed-in users' orders and stock to Lovable Cloud, so sales continue during network outages.
- Keep durable active-order drafts and sync health metadata in IndexedDB; only use cloud sync as a signed-in mirror so checkout and kitchen service remain available offline.
- Put authenticated AI Gateway calls in client-importable `*.functions.ts` RPC wrappers with server-side authorization and server-only helpers, keeping gateway secrets and prompts out of browser code.
- Sales/menu AI analysis requires owner membership in the submitted restaurant and sends only reviewed aggregates; recommendations never mutate menu or order records.
- Generate guest QR links from the canonical public origin in qr-ordering.ts, never the current editor origin, so printed cards remain usable outside preview.
- Restore guest carts before enabling persistence and treat order placement success independently of optional marketing recording, so refresh and secondary failures cannot lose carts or invite duplicate orders.
- Keep the reports installation on /insights with its own manifest and existing report calculations; this separates its installed identity without duplicating sales logic.
- Resolve app installation identity with app-install-logic and exclude app workers from development and editor hosts; this prevents stale preview assets.
